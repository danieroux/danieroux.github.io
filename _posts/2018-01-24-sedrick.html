This is the book by Krista Tippett: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25894085-becoming-wise">Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living</a> <br />
</p>

<p>
She also has an insightful podcast called <a href="https://onbeing.org">On Being</a> and part of that is the poetry project with readings, including Rilke: <a href="https://onbeing.org/projects/poetry-radio-project">Poetry Radio Project</a><br />
</p>

<p>
A journalling book recommended by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Weinberg">Jerry Weinberg</a>. Published in 1965 and I also see he has since published others too: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/627357.At_a_Journal_Workshop">At a Journal Workshop</a>. Metaphors in there are rich, and the system too is rich. Possibly too rich.<br />
</p>

<p>
The Nora Bateson book is -  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32828546-small-arcs-of-larger-circles">Small Arcs of Larger Circles: Framing through other patterns</a> <br />
</p>

<p>
We also spoke about the audio course <a href="https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/redefining-reality-the-intellectual-implications-of-modern-science.html">"Redefining Reality"</a>, thank you for that.<br />
